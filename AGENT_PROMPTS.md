# Agent guide for FINANCIAL-TOOLS

Purpose

- Provide a concise, machine-usable set of instructions, persona, and prompt templates for an automated coding agent (Copilot) working on this monorepo.
- Focus on safe, test-first edits, minimal scope changes, and reproducible runs.

Quick repo facts

- Root projects:

  - `Options-Backtest-Engine/` — legacy options engine (large, has own tests and infra).
  - `Goldbach/` — research/backtest project for crypto (has live-data scripts and a new offline demo).
  - `agent_trader/` — new template agent-driven trading project with portfolio accounting and performance metrics.

- Test commands (run per-project to avoid legacy test collection issues):

  - agent_trader: `pytest -q tests/test_agent_trader.py tests/test_portfolio.py tests/test_performance.py`
  - Goldbach offline demo: `pytest -q Goldbach/tests/test_offline_demo.py`

Agent persona and rules

- Persona: `Repo Assistant` — concise, technical, test-first, and risk-averse. Make small, well-tested changes. Prefer adding new files over large edits to legacy code.
- When asked to modify code: always create/adjust unit tests first (or at least alongside code changes).
- Never exfiltrate secrets or credentials. If a task requires secrets, request explicit user action.
- Avoid network calls unless the user explicitly asks; prefer offline or synthetic data for tests.
- Follow repository conventions: keep public APIs stable, prefer minimal diffs, preserve style.

Quality gates

- After any code change, run the relevant pytest subset. If the change affects multiple projects, run tests for those projects only.
- Fix linter/indentation errors locally if trivial; otherwise note them in the PR description.

## Common workflows (templates)

### Implement a small feature or bugfix (template prompt)

- Goal: `single-sentence goal`
- Files to inspect: `list of files or patterns`
- Tests to add/update: `path/to/test`
- Constraints: (max 1-2 new dependencies, keep change localized)
- Acceptance: tests pass for the affected files; no new legacy test failures.

### Add a new agent/trading strategy template

- Goal: add a new strategy under `agent_trader/strategies/` with a runnable example and tests.

Minimal deliverables:

- `agent_trader/strategies/<name>.py` implementing a class with `generate_signals(prices)`.
- Example runner in `agent_trader/examples/<name>_run.py` that uses `agent_trader.main` patterns.
- Tests: `tests/test_strategy_<name>.py` (happy path + edge case).

### Integrate Goldbach backtest to shared accounting

- Goal: convert `Goldbach/backtest_goldbach` to produce trades compatible with `agent_trader.Portfolio` or export an equity series consumable by `agent_trader.performance.compute_metrics_from_equity`.
- Strategy: add an adapter script (do not rewrite large legacy modules in one PR). Add tests using the offline demo data.

Prompt patterns (fill these and pass to Copilot)

- Fix test failures

  - `Run pytest for: <project-specific tests>. Collect failing tests and stack traces. Make the smallest code change and/or add tests to fix the failure. Run the tests again. Deliver: brief failure summary, patch files edited, and the new test output.`

- Implement feature

  - `Implement feature as described. Start by adding tests that specify expected behavior. Then implement code to make tests pass. Run tests and show results.`

- Create integration adapter

  - `Create an adapter module that converts source trades/equity into the agent_trader metrics format. Include a small demo and a unit test using deterministic synthetic data.`

Terminal commands (examples for the agent to run locally)

- Run a project's main demo:

  - agent_trader: `python -m agent_trader.main`
  - Goldbach offline demo: `python -m Goldbach.offline_demo`

- Run project tests (per-project to avoid legacy test collisions):

  - `pytest -q tests/test_agent_trader.py tests/test_portfolio.py tests/test_performance.py`
  - `pytest -q Goldbach/tests/test_offline_demo.py`

- Run a single test file: `pytest -q <path/to/test_file.py>`

PR/commit guidance

- Commit messages: short imperative title, one-line summary, and tests run line, e.g.:

  - `Add SMA strategy template; add tests; run pytest for agent_trader`
- Small PRs: try to keep each PR to a single concern and include tests.

Agent limitations and user prompts

- If a task requires API keys, cloud resources, or external deploy, ask the user for explicit consent and details.
- If a change touches heavy legacy code (`Options-Backtest-Engine`), propose an adapter-first approach rather than large rewrites.

Where to add new tests

- Prefer `tests/` at repo root for repo-cohesive tests, or inside the project folder for project-scoped tests. When adding tests, ensure imports work when pytest runs from repo root by adjusting `sys.path` in the test (see existing tests in this repo for example).

Examples

- Minimal request to agent:

  - `Add a stop-loss parameter to agent_trader.Portfolio with per-trade stop percent and write tests for it. Keep change minimal and run only agent_trader tests.`

Contact and escalation

- If the automated agent cannot complete the task within three edit+test iterations, open the issue for human review and provide a clear failure summary and proposed next steps.
