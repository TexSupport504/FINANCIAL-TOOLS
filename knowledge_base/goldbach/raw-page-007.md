CALCULATING POWERS OF
THREE
In finance, dealing ranges are made of powers of the
number three.
In mathematics, a power of three is a number of the
form 3n where n is an integer â€“ that is, the result
of exponentiation with number three as the base and
integer n as the exponent.
You can also calculate the result multiplying the number 3
x times.
3 x 3 = 9
The result, 9, is the power of three for the integer 2., or 32
We can continue this process for any number we choose. For
example, the powers of three for the integer 5 would be:
3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 243
In excel, a powers of the number three is calculated using
following formula:
power(3, integer)
Depending on your asset, the powers of three result you
get from your calculation is either expressed in pips or in
ticks.
