For example, a fixed dealing range for foreign exchange
asset (fx) EURUSD might be 243 pips (35), while a Nasdaq
futures symbol is expressed in ticks, for example 81 (34) ticks.
Once you’re settled with a powers of three number you’re
interested in, you can calculate the dealing range.
A dealing range is a piece of price action where we expect
swings to happen. It typically has a dealing range low and a
dealing range high.
Price tend to stay inside this dealing range, unless it
breaks out this dealing range, and goes to the next partition.
When we define a dealing range we’re interested in (in
either pips or ticks), we will use this number to define the
partitions, starting from base 0.0.
For example, when we identify that a stock moves around
27 points on average (we do this visually, it will jump off from
the chart), we define the partitions for it.
Partition 1 will run from 0 -> 27
Partition 2 will run from 27 -> 56
Partition 3 will run from 56 -> 81
…
If we calculated the partitions (more on the next part), and
we see that price is aggressively trading though our levels,
we might consider doing a range expansion.
We have a part devoted to range expansion or
contraction, but basically, you take a larger PO3 number.
In our example above, the next PO3 number after 27 will
be 81, and we’ll use 81 to define our PO3 partitions.
When you’re only interested in the current PO3 partition,
because this is where current price action is taking place, go
