USING PO3 DEALING RANGES
In the previous part, we learned how to calculate the PO3
numbers. These numbers are now going to be used to define
our PO3 dealing ranges.
Remember from the previous part, we will use PO3
partitions starting from base 0, so start at the 0 level.
This can be 0 for crypto, stocks, … or 0.0 for forex.
In order to calculate the dealing range’ partition we’re
currently in for our asset – be it fx, indices, crypto, … – we
nee-d to have following variables:
- current price
the power of three number we’re interested in
We’re going to draw a fixed range, using 2 lines, which will
delineate our PO3 dealing range.
For the current price, we’re just going to open a chart, and
take the price that’s currently printing.
Now, we’re going to calculate the current PO3 dealing
range low and high.
For this, we take the current price, and remove the
decimal point, if there is one.
We are also only interested in the first 5 digits.
