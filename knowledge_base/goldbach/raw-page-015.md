dealing range high = dealing range low +
po3 number
The last step we need to do is to put back the decimal
point, at the position it originally was.
In our EURUSD example, the decimal point was after the
first position, so we get following dealing range low and high
for our 243 PO3 range
dealing range low = 1.2150
dealing range high = 1.2393
