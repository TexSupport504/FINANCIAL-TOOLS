Above you see a 243 PO3 dealing range, with equilibrium
and the 1/3 and 2/3 levels as well.
The nice thing of the PO3 ranges is that you can divide
them in 3 parts, and each of those 3 parts, will be a smaller
PO3 range in itself.
So the above 243 PO3 consists out of 3 smaller 81 PO3
ranges.
You will have a premium part, a discount part and an
equilibrium part.
We will refine the levels to be used inside the dealing
range later in this book.
If you canâ€™t wait, read up on the Huddleston levels.
