PO3 STOP RUNS
Power of three stop runs can come into 2 shapes.
Either it’s a real stop run of the buy - or sell side liquidity.
You’ll typically see a stop run under an old low or above an
old high of 27, 81, 243 pips, depending on the time frame.
Or price stops at a certain level, most likely a dealing
range high or low, and will create a wick of a PO3 size, so a
wick of 27, 81, 243 long.
If this is the case, you now have a valid rejection block,
and the open or close of the rejection block can be used to
enter a trade.
Later in this book you can read some additional
information about PO3 stop runs. Have a look for the external
range demarker section.
