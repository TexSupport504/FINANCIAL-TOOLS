RANGE EXPANSION AND
CONTRACTION
Range expansion and contraction is when the current PO3
dealing range is not sufficient anymore.
This is a concept I use with stocks, or new assets like
bitcoin for instance.
Other than using a PO3 dealing range as seen above, which I
use for forex and indices, to see what current PO3 partition
we’re in, here we just use the real PO3 numbers.
We start with one of the smallest PO3 numbers, for
example 9. If price moves out of this range we do a range
expansion, and we take the next PO3 number, which is 27.
If this range is breached to the upside, we will do another
range expansion, and we’ll take 81, 243, 729, …
If price retraces however, and we continue to make lower
prices, we do a range contraction.
Let’s say we were in the 243-729 price range, but price
moved below the 243 price range, we will now consider the
range 81-243 as our main dealing range.
