of mathematics. It states that every even natural
number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.2
So what does this mean exactly? Well weâ€™re looking for the
7 clusters of the number 100.
A cluster are 2 primes, when added them together we
have the number 100.
The number 100 is just the percentage of a range. A full
range is 100%, hence the number 100.
We can use a goldbach calculator to find all pairs for a
given number for us.
An even number can have more than 1 goldbach cluster,
and from Michaels name we understand that we need to look
for 7 clusters.
