Cluster Discount Premium
1 0 100
2 3 97
3 11 89
4 17 83
5 29 71
6 41 59
7 47 53
You can see the for each cluster, the discount number and
the premium number add up to the number 100.
These clusters also explain market symmetry. The low
number together with the high number (for example 11 and
89) are symmetrical opposed to each other.
You can identify a discount number, and a premium
number, and map the prime numbers making up a goldbach
cluster towards the IPDA levels taught by ict, as seen in the
next part.
You will also see that most partitions are 6 apart from each
other, where the 5th cluster will jump 12 steps at once, which
is where the liquidity void will reside.
So now we already have number 3 for the power of three
ranges and make up our dealing ranges, and number 6 which
separates the goldbach clusters.
