We now identified the IPDA levels, which are goldbach
levels we calculated for the number 100. The 7 pairs make up
the premium and discount levels.
You will also see that the levels are 6% apart from each
other, apart from the top and bottom.
Rejection block is only 3% apart from the high/low, and the
order block is 8% apart from the rejection block onwards.
