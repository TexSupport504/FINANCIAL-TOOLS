You will also notice that the array where the liquidity void
is (the 29/71 goldbach cluster), the levels are 12% apart.
This is the nature of a liquidity void, as this is where there
is most of the time a large on direction move, which is what
we expect due to the 12%.
To map the levels to an ict concept, like rejection block,
order block, we take the value of the level just below it until
the current value.
So for a rejection block, we take 0 -> 3 or 100 -> 97, for an
order block we take 97 -> 89 or 3 -> 11 and so on
When we map the goldbach clusters to our PO3 dealing
ranges, we get the wireframe that makes up IPDA.
