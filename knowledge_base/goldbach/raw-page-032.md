CONSEQUENT
ENCROACHMENT AND MEAN
THRESHOLD
You learned that goldbach levels are typically 6% apart
from each other, but what about CE levels.
Well, CE levels are just in the middle of 2 goldbach levels,
so typically every 3% we have a consequent encroachment
Above you can find a screenshot of ict twitter where he
just marked the CE level. This was exactly in the middle of a
PO3 dealing range with goldbach levels.
The order block levels, which starts from the rejection
block (3/97) towards the order block (11/89) is 8% in size.
The middle of 8% is 4%, hence he needed a different
name for mean threshold.
