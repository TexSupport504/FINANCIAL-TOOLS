We can conclude:
Consequent encroachment = the middle of a 6% block
Mean threshold = the middle of a 8% block
You will also see in the liquidity void levels, which are 12%,
that you can have non goldbach levels.
These are no real goldbach levels per se, as they are no
price numbers, but in my testing I find that the levels in
between the FVG->LV and the LV->BR also have a hidden 6%
level (and thus a CE level as well), so on my charts (when I
use a large enough PO3 dealing range, so my screen is not
cluttered with lines), I also draw following levels:
35 and 65
23 and 77
And I call these the non gb levels.
