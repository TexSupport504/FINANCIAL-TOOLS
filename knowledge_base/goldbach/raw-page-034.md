EXTERNAL RANGE
DEMARKERS
We defined dealing ranges using PO3 values. This defines
our range, and this comes both with internal range, where we
use our goldbach IPDA levels, but there’s also external range.
External range is also defined by PO3 levels, and this is
something we learned in the PO3 chapter, part about PO3
stop runs.
Basically what you do is add following fib values to your
fibonacci tool:
Range high: 1.111
Range low: -0.111
Using these fib values is putting a PO3 (-2) level on the
chart.
What this means is, it highlights stop runs of 2 lower PO3
numbers.
For example, if you’re currently using a 2187 PO3 dealing
range, it will put a stop run level of 2 PO3 lower, which is not
729, but 243.
For 243, it will be not 81, but 27, and so on.
This will give you an indication on where price will go to in
case it breaches the dealing range, for a brief moment of
time.
You’ll often see that a big move starts from an external
range remarker as well.
