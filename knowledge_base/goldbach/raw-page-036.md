ALGORITHMS
So if we are using a Tesla Vortex, but we base the calculation
of our modular multiplication on the number we have here,
we can come up with the theory between the 2 alsoâ€™s ict
described.
We now understand the price action runs using PO3
numbers (the number 3), and goldbach levels.
We also identified the 14 different IPDA levels, which are
the pairs that make up the 7 goldbach clusters of the number
100 (our full dealing range in percentages)
So we will feed this in our vortex calculator:
Modulus: 14
Multiplier: 3
