So we have 2 sets of data:
1 3 9 13 11 5
2 6 4 12 8 10
If we map this to our goldbach values we found, where 1 =
0 = high, 2 = rejection block, 3 = order block, â€¦
We get following graph
You can see here that algo 1 is reflecting the MMxM, and
algo 2 is a trending algorithm, creating OTE (optimal trade
entries) along the way up or down.
