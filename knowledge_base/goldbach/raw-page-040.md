Now we understand how we need to create the dealing
ranges (using the PO3 numbers), and we understand the
levels inside these dealing ranges (using goldbach), and we
understand that price is offered by any of the 2 algorithms,
we can get to work.
In below screenshot, we identified for the EURUSD chart,
the current 729 PO3 partition.
This partition runs from 1.0206 towards 1.0935, or the 14th
729 partition from base 0.0
14*729=10206 (dealing range low)
10206 + 729 = 10935 (dealing range high)
-> add decimal point for EURUSD
When we put the range low and range high in our
calculator, and we specify this is a 729 range, we can
calculate the IPDA levels using the goldbach levels.
Using algo 2 for a bullish scenario, you can see that price
is respecting the levels outlined by our algo.
You can see in the screenshot that an order block was
created, a fair value accompanied by it, price returned into
the OB+FVG, price expand away above equilibrium, price
