INTRODUCTION
The 20-40-60 loopback is where the number 9 comes into
play.
We just use a sequence of the number 9 to define our
partitions that make up the loopback anchor points, but we
ignore the first number 9.
As to why we ignore the first 9 (and another one later in
the sequence), this will become clear in a moment.
The sequence we will use is:
18-27-36-45-54-63-72-81-99-108-117-126
This sequence is to be used on the daily chart, and
delineate the partitions.
W-e will break the numbers of the sequence in 2 parts:
the first digit in case the complete number < 100, else
w-e take the first 2 digits. This will make up the month
The last digit. This will make up the day of that specific
month
We will come up with following table
Number Month Day
18 January 8
27 February 7
36 March 6
45 April 5
54 May 4
63 June 3
