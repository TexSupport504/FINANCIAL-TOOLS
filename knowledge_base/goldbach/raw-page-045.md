The days of the specific month will make up our anchor
points, so it’s best to open a daily chart, and draw 12 lines for
the year, given the specific day for the month.
Should a day fall on a weekend, you use the following
trading day, typically Monday following the weekend.
If for example you need to draw the vertical line for May
the 4th, but this day falls on a Saturday, you would draw a
vertical line for Monday the 6th for that specific year.
You’ll now understand why we don’t use the numbers 09
and 90, as there is no Month 0 with a day 9, and there is no
day 0 in the 9th month.
Now we have defined the partitions, marking up the
loopback periods, it’s time to put them in action.
At the start of the new partition, we look for a clue based
on the specific number of that partition.
For example, if we started the partition for the month of
October, we will use the number 108.
With this number (108 in this case), we will look for a stop
run of 108 pips in any of the previous 3 partitions (the
20-40-60 lookback).
What is also possible is that you don’t need to look for a
stop run, but that you’ll find a FVG of this amount of pips
