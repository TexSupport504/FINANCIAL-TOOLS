The last possibility is that there’s an order block in close
proximity, with this size (108 for October).
At the start of the new partition, you typically look for the
first few trading days of the new partition to hit either the
liquidity, the fair value gap or the order block.
We expect price to aggressively trade away (reverse) from
this point, and we expect a PO3 stop run on the opposite
direction.
This PO3 stop run can be either a real liquidity stop run, or
when you see a PO3 size wick, it’s possible this wick is used
as a target.
When the PO3 stop run occurred, you’ll typically see that
price goes back into the trading range defined for the current
partition.
