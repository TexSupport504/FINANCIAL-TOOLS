HIPPO
You’ll find references to HIPPO in the following examples.
This is an “invention” of me, to demonstrate that if you
understand the price levels (huddleston/goldbach), you can
create any trading system around it, give a concept a name of
your liking.
That’s why I came up with the HIPPO:
H: HIDDEN
I : INTERBANK
P: PRICE
P: POINT
O: OBJECTIVE
Basically, a HIPPO is a “hidden” order block, where you
take the wicks of 2 consecutive bars.
You do not take any 2 bars, but the bars should create a
fair value gap.
