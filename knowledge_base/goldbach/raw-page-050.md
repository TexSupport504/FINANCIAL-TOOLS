JANUARY
1 8
In January, which is the first month of the year, we should
start at the 8th.
This is however a weekend day, so we will take the first
Monday following this day, so we arrive at January the 10th.
We are still looking for either gaps or stop runs of 18 pips
just when the new partition starts.
4 trading days into the new partition, we can see a 18 pip
gap residing 2 partitions ago (40 day lookback)
When we hit this level, price breaks down, and it does a 81
PO3 stop run, triggering the reversal in price.
