FEBRUARY
2 7
February, the second month of the year, we will start at the
7th.
We are looking for a 27 pip stop run or a gap.
On the 4th trading day, we see we hit the 27 pip stop run
of the previous partition.
Price breaks down, and does a 243 PO3 stop run, closing
the current partition, and be ready for the March partition.
