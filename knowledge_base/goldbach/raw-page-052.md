MARCH
3 6
March, the 3rd month of the year, we look to start at the 6th.
Immediately out of the gate, we took out the previous
partitions low with 36 pips.
The draw on liquidity was the bearish order block, but
before we reached there, we first left a 36 pip gap.
The order block was later traded to just before the
partition closed.
