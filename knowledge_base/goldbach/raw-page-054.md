MAY
5 4
May, the 5th month where we look for 54 pip stop runs or
gaps, is interesting.
We can see a nice gap of 54 pips but whatâ€™s interesting is
there is a HIPPO to it, which is used as the reaction point.
You can also witness the 54 pip gap below the HIPPO, so
the HIPPO is made out of 2 54 pip gaps.
When the HIPPO triggered the sell off, we did a 81 PO3
stop run, where price reversed and headed to another 54 pip
gap in the previous partition.
