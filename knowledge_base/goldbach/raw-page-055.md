Here, on the 6th month, price traded into a 63 pip order block
created in the previous partition.
The rejection block was used to drive price down,
Should you not see this order block, and were looking for
the 63 pip sell side stop run, you will have a failed swing (and
potential loss).
Price sold off into a PO3 rejection block (the wicks are 27
PO3 number), and price reversed.
It reversed into the HIPPO which was created at the top of
the failed 63 swing.
