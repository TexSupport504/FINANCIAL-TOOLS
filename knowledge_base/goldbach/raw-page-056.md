JUL
7 2
The partition for the 7th month should start on the 2nd, but as
this was a weekend, we use the following trading day, which
was Monday 4th 2022.
If you missed to see the 72 pip order block which was
created at the end of the previous partition, you will face a
loss when the 72 stop run block was ran through.
A HIPPO was created at the bottom of the 72 pip stop run,
and we saw a 243 PO3 stop run straight from the HIPPO.
Price ran back into the HIPPO after the 243 PO3 stop run
on the sell side occurred.
