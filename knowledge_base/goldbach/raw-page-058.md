SEP
9 0 - 9 9
Now, the 9th month is something special. We should take day
0, but obviously there is no day 0, so we add 9 again, and
arrive at 99.
Here we saw a nice 99 pip stop run of a swing created in
the previous partition, and price sold off.
By now, you know the drill. You look for a PO3 stop run,
which came in as a 243 PO3 stop run.
Price returned back into a bearish order block.
