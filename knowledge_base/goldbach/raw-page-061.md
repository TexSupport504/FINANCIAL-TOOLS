DEC
12 6
The last month of the year is a bit special, as this is a
consolidation profile most of the time.
We could see a nice 126 pip stop run on the highs of the
previous partition (20 day lookback).
The PO3 stop run was under the current partition low,
which is a hallmark for the consolidation profile.
Also note that the partition for December runs into the first
trading days of the next year.
