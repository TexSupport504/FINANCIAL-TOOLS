We can do the same like we did above to layout the yearly
expectations, but now for a given day.
We are using the CLS timings for this, so a true day goes
from 20:00-20:00 CET, which is 19:00-19:00 BST or
14:00-14:00 EST
You can see there that we have a accumulation phase
during the Asian session, the London session breaks out of
the Asian consolidation and retraces back into the
consolidation during the manipulation phase (and forms the
Judas), and price is being distributed during New York.
