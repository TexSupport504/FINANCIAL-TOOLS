Now, I told you that we can break each phase into smaller
AMD phases, as price is fractal.
So if we look for instance at the manipulation phase of the
above screenshot, we can fine tune it using the smaller AMD
cycle
You can see the accumulation phase, this is violated
(market structure shift) and retraced back into (to form an
OTE).
After the retracement into the consolidation of the
accumulation phase, we expand into a pool of interest
(liquidity, fvg, â€¦)
At this moment, we will reverse price. You will see that the
reversal will typically be in the middle of the distribution cycle.
