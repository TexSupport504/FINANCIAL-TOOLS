Ever since the gauntlet thread and the CLS thread on the
innercircletrader mentorship, I said the mentorship was setup
as a big puzzle that is for us to crack.
I hope that at least I shed some light on some of the
puzzles that were hidden in the mentorship.
By no means I claim to have cracked “enigma” but I hope
what was shared in this book is helpful to you in becoming
the trader you want to become.
The book will be updated whenever I discover more
interesting topics, or relations with teachings ict shared.
Thanks for reading!
